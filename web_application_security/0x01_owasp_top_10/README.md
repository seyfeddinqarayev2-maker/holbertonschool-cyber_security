# OWASP Top 10

This project is a deep dive into the **OWASP Top 10**, the standard awareness document for developers and web application security. It represents a broad consensus on the most critical security risks to web applications. Understanding these vulnerabilities is fundamental for any cybersecurity professional or web developer aiming to build secure, resilient systems.
